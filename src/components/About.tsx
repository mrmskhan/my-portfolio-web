      I am currently a student of Artificial Intelligence, 
                passionate about learning cutting-edge technologies 
                and building innovative projects. As part of my academic
                 journey, I am working on web development projects where 
                 I am gaining hands-on experience with HTML, CSS, TypeScript, 
                 and Next.js. This website is a reflection of my learning and 
                 skills as I strive to improve my knowledge in AI and web
                  development. My goal is to develop creative and functional 
                  solutions that solve real-world problems. Thank you for 
                  visiting my project, and I hope you find it informative 
                  and engaging!
